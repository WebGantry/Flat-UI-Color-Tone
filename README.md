FlatUITone
==========

A 'stupidly-simple', web-based tool for Web-master & Designers; who are working or designing using the "Flat UI" (User Interface).

Flat UI Tone; a tool which helps Web-master & Designers choose their perfect Flat UI-based Color for their project.

It offers all generic Flat UI Colors; but adds "Shades" and "Tint" colors options as well; with the HEX code. The first ever site/tool on the Internet to offer these options.

We feature two Color Palettes, the first one; on the left-hand side row is the "Shades" bit (FlatUIColor <-> Darker Color) and the one on the right-hand side row is the "Tone" color (FlatUIColor <-> Lighter Color). 

Inspired by: Flat UI Kit by Designmodo, Twitter Bootstrap Framework & COLORlovers.

Feel free to Phork, I mean "Fork" this project and make it better, if you so wish. *Coffee*
